(NB: I have more-recently framed this within the context of web sites, so my examples will pull from this, but the concepts hold through other software engineering targets and environments.)</p>\n<p>This attribute is not probably what you may think--raw intellect, flexibility, skill, and improvisation ability all certainly have their place and are important, but they are not singular in differentiating between good software and engineers, and outstanding software and engineers.</p>\n<p>It comes down to a simple word with potentially-complicated implementation: <em>consideration</em>.</p>\n<p>Consideration in design means that the end-user or stakeholder is held in mind and the software is designed around their needs and not what is easiest or most "exciting" to build. Consideration means that engineers think deeply about disabilities--such as color-blindness or blindness--and implement reasonable accommodation to ensure a good user experience. Consideration means not lying--either overtly or by omission--to users, stakeholders, or other engineers. Consideration means writing and supporting documentation. Consideration means writing and updating test suites to ease troubleshooting.</p>\n<p>Consideration, of course, takes time. Consideration takes a mature team and support infrastructure that considers the next three years or three months versus looking only at the next three weeks or three days. Consideration, in light of and against this backdrop, requires an ever-vigilant allowance for taking the time to do something properly and correctly rather than pasting over poor software with increasingly-worse software.</p>\n<p>Inconsiderate Software:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reports a file or template or other data as "saved" when in fact no such operation has begun.</li>\n<li>Consistently fails to implement a11y or WebAIM or W3C\'s LVTF or <a href="https://www.section508.gov/">Section 508</a> suggestions.</li>\n<li>Presents text layout in ways that aren\'t useful to low-vision readers (e.g. displaying linked resources in text with a different color versus underlining the text link) or screen-reading software (e.g. providing appropriate <code>aria</code> tags).</li>\n<li>Contains buttons that are are either wildly over-scoped ("do everything" buttons) or have labels that do not describe what action will be performed when they are pressed ("do something different-than-described" buttons).</li>\n<li>Even worse: contains buttons that <em>say</em> they will carry out one action, but actually <em>do</em> some other action.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Inconsiderate Software Engineers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Believe that using TDD and implementing even rudimentary smoke-tests a waste of time.</li>\n<li>Believe documentation, even at the block-diagram level, is an even larger waste of time.</li>\n<li>Treat colleagues with disdain or even outright abuse them.</li>\n<li>Outright lie to colleagues about work, resources, the product, and goals.</li>\n<li>Are unprofessional in their conduct for extended periods of time, and are unapologetic about this (see the previous couple bullet-points).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>aa</p>',frontmatter:{date:"February 08, 2019",path:"/blog/2019-02-08_on-software-engineering",title:"On Software Engineering"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
